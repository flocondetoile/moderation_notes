Moderation Notes
====================

About this module
-----------------
Moderation Notes allows you to notate and review Entities that are moderated with Content Moderation.

In addition to adding basic notes, you can also add important notes that block Content Moderation States.
Until all Important notes are resolved, the Entity can not move forward with your workflow. This is critical for
reviewers who want to take a "red pen" to an Entity and ensure that their note is resolved.
